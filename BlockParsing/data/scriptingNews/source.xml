                          . &quot;The [$43 million] gift, announced last Thursday by Secretary of State Colin Powell, in addition to other recent aid, makes the US the main sponsor of the Taliban and rewards that &#39;rogue regime&#39; for declaring that opium growing is against the will of God. So, too, by the Taliban&#39;s estimation, are most human activities, but it&#39;s the ban on drugs that catches this administration&#39;s attention.&quot;

                          that Scripting News is now available in OPML, in addition to all previous XMLizations. And since I&#39;d like to get some work done this week, I decided to make this the first item. Heh. I also posted announcements on quite a few XML-oriented mail lists. Getting the news out to people is part of what we do, so it&#39;s on topic, even though we&#39;re all still obsessing about all that we&#39;re obsessing about.

                          I spoke on the phone with my friend Dave Jacobs, who, due to a family emergency, is traveling from SF to Raleigh, NC, and then driving seven hours with a three hour ferry trip to Ocracoke, an island on the
                          <a href="http://www.nps.gov/caha/map.htm">Outer Banks</a>

                          of NC. Murphy-willing, his trip will take him through Los Angeles, Dallas and Washington. Dave will see a lot of the US air system today. He says &quot;There&#39;s an incredible sense of comraderie and calm at the airport, the lines at the ticket counters went out the door. There are hundreds and hundreds of people in the lines, but everyone is very calm, tearful eyes, everybody, a lot of talking among people of just how sad things are. Everyone has cellphones. Lots of families traveling with kids. I believe our air system is truly safe now, I&#39;m traveling without any fear.&quot;
                          <br />

                          <br />

                          Dave called from LA and DC. He says that LA was very tense. Cops, army, everywhere. &quot;Don&#39;t stand there sir, it makes us nervous,&quot; a cop said to Dave. The people he met in LA were the first wave from Asia, people who were stranded there. Lots of pilots. The Red Cross people are all in shock, many are crying. The flight attendants talk about people they knew who died. Obviously the DC airport is open (NPR is reporting otherwise) and quiet. Dave&#39;s journey continues, cellphones are great. I told him he has a lot of courage to do what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s headed to a big mess in NC, but he&#39;s doing it for love.

This begs the question of whether these evidence trails were intentionally left in order to distract U.S. law enforcement from other terrorists.&quot;

I want a telephone number that I can call that records a message, stores it as an MP3 on a static server, and emails me the URL. Then I would run a script that moves it to a UserLand server, and link to it from Scripting News. This would allow me to interview people. This is something I like to do. If we can find such a service, I&#39;d like to buy some stock. There would be a per-minute charge. Reliability and service would matter.

                          Most interesting idea heard today, from Lee Th&#233; at Fawcette. Even though Americans were victims on Tuesday, as soon as we get over the initial shock and pain, let&#39;s find out what we&#39;re doing wrong, and fix it. The US is the Microsoft of the world. We look to the left and right and see good people and don&#39;t understand that there&#39;s something wrong at the top. That&#39;s what the rest of the world has to deal with. It
                          <i>does</i>

                          matter who leads us. When we vote we don&#39;t use our power.
                          <br />

                          <br />

                          People don&#39;t sacrifice themselves for no reason. Let&#39;s find out what it is. And if we did something wrong (no doubt we did) let&#39;s apologize, ask for forgiveness, and then ask how we can do better. It&#39;s clear now that when we screw up we&#39;re going to feel it. And let&#39;s not waste the unity in the rest of the world. We now have the attention of the leaders of all the other countries. We&#39;ve got to find a better use for it than use it as an excuse to unleash our anger through military force. What a waste that would be. The rest of the world isn&#39;t stupid, and they probably don&#39;t like the way we&#39;ve been dominating. I wouldn&#39;t if I were in their shoes.

                          I want to shift gears today out of navel-gazing -- that fog lifted for me last night --it&#39;s time to decide what our goals are. The pervasive fear of retribution is a tool for the US president. Now I&#39;d like to see an LBJ-like approach, let us reason together, how can we all win now. It&#39;s OK to think about the dead, but they&#39;re dead. Think about all the people who are alive now who will be dead if we go to war. American culture is so self-centered, now we&#39;re part of the rest of the world. Security in Europe is pretty heavy. So what. We&#39;ll get over it. Now how can we use our new unity to make some peace. This is our wakeup call. Wake up.

For most of the day the Times home page had little or nothing about the crisis. We, collectively, got on it very quickly once it was clear that the the news sites were choked with flow and didn&#39;t have very much info. Hat-tip to

                          These were not terrorist attacks. The Pentagon is the US military headquarters. It&#39;s an impossible stretch to see that as terrorism. If the targets of attack were only civillian targets, that&#39;s terrorism. This picture must haunt the military. Soldiers look helplessly as their headquarters burns and their colleagues die.

                          Just talked with him on the phone. He was in Grand Central Station when the subways shut down. He walked from mid-town over the 59th Street Bridge with thousands of other New Yorkers. He didn&#39;t know the planes were hijacked. What a relief that both my parents survived. And thanks for all the good wishes.

                          Still no word from my father. I just went outside and heard a plane overhead. On most days that would be a pretty normal thing. Today I wondered what was going on on that plane. A friend was coming to visit from Florida for the weekend. Now that&#39;s off. It&#39;s just beginning to sink in how much things have changed. Yesterday would it have made no sense to run a survey to ask if we are at war. Yesterday was a normal day. Today started normally too. I have a feeling that the takeaway from this will be
                          <i>There&#39;s No Time Like Now.</i>

                          Yeah, there&#39;s no time like now to start forgiving, to turn the other cheek, to show the world not that we&#39;re tough, but that we&#39;re commited to making the world a better place. Do I think our government will do that? No I don&#39;t.

I wondered if you might have a minute to talk about the impulse to collect and share news and reaction and how the Net facilitates that.&quot; I can&#39;t get through to NY on the phone. I see this as an opportunity to cover a big news story, it&#39;s largely the same reason the NY Times home page is all about this. We want to figure out what happened, what it means, and where we go from here. The world changed today. It&#39;s still very fresh. Is there an opportunity for something good to come from this? I think so. Talking with my mother on the phone she&#39;s sure that Jewish people will be blamed for this. I asked can we hope for something better to come from this. Perhaps a new connection between peace-loving people everywhere?

A helocopter has fallen on to the mall, the White House has been evacuated along with Treasury and others. This is deep. The two planes were a 767 from Boston (Logan) hijacked and the second was a United flight. The Sears tower is being evacuated.&quot;
