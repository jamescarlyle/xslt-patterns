                . &quot;The [$43 million] gift, announced last Thursday by Secretary of State Colin Powell, in addition to other recent aid, makes the US the main sponsor of the Taliban and rewards that &#39;rogue regime&#39; for declaring that opium growing is against the will of God. So, too, by the Taliban&#39;s estimation, are most human activities, but it&#39;s the ban on drugs that catches this administration&#39;s attention.&quot; Hmmm.

How would you imagine the beings on the planet spend their days? Do you think they worry a lot about a building on the other side of the sphere? How many people do you think live there? 25? 250? You might be surprised to learn that most of the people on the planet live in this part. Billions of people. Is it any wonder they&#39;re angry with each other? You would be too if it was so crowded!

                <link href="http://www.nps.gov/caha/map.htm">Outer Banks</link>

                of NC. Murphy-willing, his trip will take him through Los Angeles, Dallas and Washington. Dave will see a lot of the US air system today. He says &quot;There&#39;s an incredible sense of comraderie and calm at the airport, the lines at the ticket counters went out the door. There are hundreds and hundreds of people in the lines, but everyone is very calm, tearful eyes, everybody, a lot of talking among people of just how sad things are. Everyone has cellphones. Lots of families traveling with kids. I believe our air system is truly safe now, I&#39;m traveling without any fear.&quot; Dave called from LA and DC. He says that LA was very tense. Cops, army, everywhere. &quot;Don&#39;t stand there sir, it makes us nervous,&quot; a cop said to Dave. The people he met in LA were the first wave from Asia, people who were stranded there. Lots of pilots. The Red Cross people are all in shock, many are crying. The flight attendants talk about people they knew who died. Obviously the DC airport is open (NPR is reporting otherwise) and quiet. Dave&#39;s journey continues, cellphones are great. I told him he has a lot of courage to do what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s headed to a big mess in NC, but he&#39;s doing it for love. Tech news

                : &quot;In Britain, as across Europe, there was a three minute silence today at 11 in the morning. In my office, people switched off their computer screens and concentrated on private thoughts. What was extraordinary was the lack of sound. The bustling square outside our office was suddenly stilled, with no taxis or errant car alarms breaking the hush.&quot;

                I was asking for a scanner for a long time, I got it, and it&#39;s revolutionized coverage of concepts on Scripting News. I have another dream. I want a telephone number that I can call that records a message, stores it as an MP3 on a static server, and emails me the URL. Then I would run a script that moves it to a UserLand server, and link to it from Scripting News. This would allow me to interview people. This is something I like to do. If we can find such a service, I&#39;d like to buy some stock. There would be a per-minute charge. Reliability and service would matter. Tech news

                Most interesting idea heard today, from Lee Th&#233; at Fawcette. Even though Americans were victims on Tuesday, as soon as we get over the initial shock and pain, let&#39;s find out what we&#39;re doing wrong, and fix it. The US is the Microsoft of the world. We look to the left and right and see good people and don&#39;t understand that there&#39;s something wrong at the top. That&#39;s what the rest of the world has to deal with. It does matter who leads us. When we vote we don&#39;t use our power. People don&#39;t sacrifice themselves for no reason. Let&#39;s find out what it is. And if we did something wrong (no doubt we did) let&#39;s apologize, ask for forgiveness, and then ask how we can do better. It&#39;s clear now that when we screw up we&#39;re going to feel it. And let&#39;s not waste the unity in the rest of the world. We now have the attention of the leaders of all the other countries. We&#39;ve got to find a better use for it than use it as an excuse to unleash our anger through military force. What a waste that would be. The rest of the world isn&#39;t stupid, and they probably don&#39;t like the way we&#39;ve been dominating. I wouldn&#39;t if I were in their shoes. More

It&#39;s OK to think about the dead, but they&#39;re dead. Think about all the people who are alive now who will be dead if we go to war. American culture is so self-centered, now we&#39;re part of the rest of the world. Security in Europe is pretty heavy. So what. We&#39;ll get over it. Now how can we use our new unity to make some peace. This is our wakeup call. Wake up. Non-WTC links

                &quot;Within a few hours, we will see beginning the most vigorous efforts to end what remains of freedom in America. Those of who are willing to sacrifice a little - largely illusory - safety in order to maintain our faith in the original ideals of America will have to fight for those ideals just as vigorously.&quot;

                These were not terrorist attacks. The Pentagon is the US military headquarters. It&#39;s an impossible stretch to see that as terrorism. If the targets of attack were only civillian targets, that&#39;s terrorism. This picture must haunt the military. Soldiers look helplessly as their headquarters burns and their colleagues die. The attack on the Pentagon was an act of war. Internet News:

                walking around Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens, send me an email. Still no word from my father. I just went outside and heard a plane overhead. On most days that would be a pretty normal thing. Today I wondered what was going on on that plane. A friend was coming to visit from Florida for the weekend. Now that&#39;s off. It&#39;s just beginning to sink in how much things have changed. Yesterday would it have made no sense to run a survey to ask if we are at war. Yesterday was a normal day. Today started normally too. I have a feeling that the takeaway from this will be There&#39;s No Time Like Now. Yeah, there&#39;s no time like now to start forgiving, to turn the other cheek, to show the world not that we&#39;re tough, but that we&#39;re commited to making the world a better place. Do I think our government will do that? No I don&#39;t.

She says: &quot;I am working on a story about how people are responding across the Net to the news of today&#39;s terrorist attacks, and I noticed that you&#39;re devoting your blog to it.

We want to figure out what happened, what it means, and where we go from here. The world changed today. It&#39;s still very fresh. Is there an opportunity for something good to come from this? I think so. Talking with my mother on the phone she&#39;s sure that Jewish people will be blamed for this. I asked can we hope for something better to come from this. Perhaps a new connection between peace-loving people everywhere? AP:
