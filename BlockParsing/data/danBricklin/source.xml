              In response to my mention of <i>Surf and Sip</i> 802.11b Internet access in a small coffee shop on the <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/albums/ibmpc20th/nextday.htm" target="_top" title="http://www.bricklin.com/albums/ibmpc20th"><u>last page</u></a> of my 20th Anniversary Celebration album, I've been trading email with <a href="http://www.surfandsip.com/" target="_top" title="http://www.surfandsip.com/"><u><i><b>Surf and Sip</b></i></u></a> <b>president, Rick Ehrlinspiel</b>. He's really excited by local 802.11b, and has <b>signed up 70 shops so far</b>, using what sounds like a conservative (as opposed to pre-bubble) financing style. He can do this because <b>802.11b seems to meet a real need for people and is financially viable for the coffee shops</b>. It is used despite well-known problems (e.g., need to buy additional hardware, security issues, etc.). <b>Many other more-hyped technologies have not yet reached this point (if they ever will).</b>

            <div>
              The shops end up with 802.11b Internet connectivity to customers' laptops as well as some on-location rental machines. Quite a few people sit for more than a quick stop each day in each of their licensees. I think the fact you can use their machine the first time helps. Why play a video game for 50 cents every few minutes when you can catch up on email, IM, or whatever for about the same ($5-10/hour)? (Actually, they don't charge for your machine, yet, and are still seeing cash-flow.) <b>Unlike the Internet cafes frequented by travelers, the capital requirements here are much lower because people mainly bring their own machines.</b> As Bill Gurley <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/albums/internetsummit2001/latertuesday.htm" target="_top" title="http://www.bricklin.com/albums/internets"><u>pointed out</u></a> at the Internet Summit a few weeks ago, <b>this is a real grassroots, small business thing.</b> Very much like the early post-Netscape 1.0 Internet. Rick's asked me for the names of appropriate shops in Boston to approach. (Do you know which to recommend? He has a "Contact Us" page on his web site...)

              On August 12, 1981, <b>the day the IBM PC was announced</b>, VisiCalc's developers, Software Arts, held a staff meeting to go over what was happening. Like most of our full staff meetings, it was videotaped with home video equipment so employees that missed it could watch it later. Little did we realize that <b>a segment of this tape would appear as part of PBS's</b> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/" target="_top" title="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/"><u><b>Triumph of the Nerds</b></u></a> TV documentary 15 years later. PBS people told me that at the time they put the show together it was the only appropriate video they could find from that day.

The lack of attention to the operating system (Microsoft's) and microprocessor (Intel's) in all the material is also quite interesting.
