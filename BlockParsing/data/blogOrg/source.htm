<div class="posts"><a id="5693877" name="5693877"></a> <span
class="rss:item">It seems to be obligatory to post up something
about Tuesday's appalling events. I try to apply a utilitarian
approach to problems, however emotive they may be. As a result, I
am apprehensive when I hear talk about a "war" on terrorism and
particularly early press speculation about a possible invasion of
Afghanistan (or possibly a punitive expedition?). Paul Wolfowitz,
deputy Pentagon chief, is quoted as saying the US would "end states
which sponsor terrorism." The terrorist attacks themselves were bad
enough, but there is a danger that:<br />
</span>
<p>1) they may encourage further bigotry among Americans against
Muslims and/or arabs, most of whom are not at all sympathetic to
the aims of the terrorists. In the Telegraph here in the UK <a
href="http://www.linkcounter.com/go.php?linkid=177191">Daniel
Pipes</a> suggests 10-15% of Muslims are "Islamists" (his term for
militants) and says we must worry about Islamist "sleepers" (or in
other words any Muslim even if they *seem* peaceable).<br />
</p>

<p>2) they may cause huge disruption to people's lives in a futile
attempt to make the world "safe". I don't think it is actually
possible to secure the world against determined terrorists without
an unacceptable level of inconvenience and paranoia. <a
href="http://www.linkcounter.com/go.php?linkid=177192">John
Keegan</a>, Defence Editor of the Telegraph has already suggested
that ISPs should be required to forbid the transmission of
encrypted messages (!) and uncompliant providers on foreign
territory should expect their buildings to be destroyed by cruise
missiles (!!!)<br />
</p>

<p>3) they may cause the US to lash out blindly against people they
see as enemies - if they attack Afghanistan or other nations which
house terrorists they will likely cause large civilian casualties
and huge resentment in the Muslim world, breeding many more
terrorists to take their place.<br />
</p>

<p>4) they may set back the middle east peace process for years to
come. Simplifying grossly, Israel is the intransigent party these
days and Bush was already closely aligned with Israel. Now there is
a danger that some Palestinians' anger at the US for historical
reasons will be exploited by opponents of their cause to make a
just settlement look like surrender to terrorism.<br />
</p>

<p>If the terrorists and their leaders can be found and killed or
captured, of course I would like to see that happen (and I wouldn't
be too fussy about the methods used as long as they weren't
indiscriminate like cruise missiles) but I think it would be both
wrong and dangerous to make this into a larger war or crusade. The
terrorists don't represent anyone but themselves - if we launch a
jihad against a whole culture then they will have achieved their
goal.<br />
</p>

<p>Frankly, I believe that even this lacklustre President would not
be foolish enough to ignite such a conflagration (and if he were, I
doubt his advisors would let him) but I still worry that the
inflammatory suggestions like the ones we are starting to see in
the press are deeply un-helpful.<br />
